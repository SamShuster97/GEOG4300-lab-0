```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

This "lab" assignment provides an opportunity to learn the basic mechanics of Github classroom, loading data, and doing some basic operations using the tools in the tidyverse. 

We'll be combining two datasets for this assignment: the New York Times dataset on COVID case counts by county and the American Community Survey's most recent data on county population. You can load them both using the read_csv function and either the URL or path. For example, you can load the ACS data using this function:

```{r}
county_pop<-read_csv("data/pop_acs18.csv")
```

In this dataset, you'll see a county FIPS code (GEOID), county name, the variable code for total population, a population estimate, and a margin of error (which is blank in this case). 

## Loading the data

### Question 1 (2 points):
Load these data using the read_csv command. You can copy the code above for the county population data. For the New York Times data, replace the file path name with this URL:

* https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/raw/master/us-counties.csv

```{r}
##Your code goes here.
county_pop<-read_csv("data/pop_acs18.csv")
nytimesdata<-read_csv("https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/raw/master/us-counties.csv")
```

## Connecting the data

Next you'll need to join these two datasets using the left_join function (discussed in this week's lectures/scripts). To do so you'll need to have two fields with the same name in each dataset. The fips codes are in both datasets, but they have different names (GEOID and fips) and formats (numeric and character). The following code creates a new variable called fips in the ACS data that's a character using the mutate function.

```{r}
county_pop<-county_pop %>%
  mutate(fips=as.character(GEOID))
```

Call the function above to rename your data. Now you're ready to join the data.
```{r}
county_pop
```
### Question 2 (2 points)
Using inner_join, join the New York Times dataset to the county population one. 

```{r}
joined_data<-inner_join(county_pop, nytimesdata)
county_pop
```

### Question 3 (3 points)
Find some documentation on the inner_join function online or using help in R. How is it different from left_join or full_join? List the source you used for your answer.

{The inner_join differs from the left_join in that it only retains rows that are shared by both data sets as opposed to retaining all rows from the first data set and then matching the corresponding rows from the second data set. The full_join matches corresponding rows from both data sets and joins them but unlike the left_join, it does not exclude rows from the second data set that do not correspondingly match to any rows in the first data set. I used the cheat sheet for data-transformation provided within the rstudio cloud environment under the learning resources section. Source: "https://rstudio.cloud/learn/cheat-sheets"}

## Calculating a rate
Now you can calculate a case rate by county, also using mutate. These are usually reported as cases per 100,000 population You'll need to set up some math that follows the following pattern:

* newvar = cases / population * 100000

### Question 4 (2 points)
Use mutate to calculate a case rate per 100,000 people.

```{r}
case_rate<-joined_data %>%
  mutate(Case_rate=cases/estimate * 100000)
```

### Question 5 (1 point)
Which Georgia county has the *highest* case rate according to your analysis? You can open the dataset and click on the column name for the rate to arrange from high to low. Give the county name, the rate, and the date when this rate was calculated.

{Chattahoochee County appears to have the highest case rate with a rate of 9900.622}

That's it! When you're done with this lab, use the Knit command to render it as a Github markdown document. Then push it up to Github using the procedure outlined in this week's videos.
